# WeeklyChallenge

Every week, a programming problem will be posted here. The challenge will be placed in a README.md under a folder with the date that the challenge was issued:

`WeeklyChallenge/12_04_16/README.md`

Everyone will have one week from the time of posting to submit their solution. Solutions should be submitted by opening a PR on this repo with a single file or a folder containing multiple files under the the current week with your discord handle as the name:

`WeeklyChallenge/12_04_16/discordHandle.js` OR `WeeklyChallenge/12_04_16/discord_handle/`
